# Fact-checking bot
This bot is currently offline.

A reddit bot that utilizes the google [fact check tools API](https://developers.google.com/fact-check/tools/api/) to retrieve claim analysis related to an arbitrary, user-provided query. The bot will (attempt to) nicely present the most relevant claims, including the source and the source's verdict. This bot is meant to provide an efficient way to broadcast truth in response to a questionable comment. The user that calls the bot must provide the necessary keywords to find the claim if it exists - see usage below. 

# Usage
**This bot is currently decommissioned.** When it was active, it monitored this list of subreddits:

r/politics<br/>
r/news<br/>
r/worldnews<br/>
r/Liberal<br />
r/Conservative<br/>
r/Libertarian<br/>

Comments with the syntax `!factcheck <query>`, where \<query> is a string of search terms, were used to search for relevant fact-checks. Thus, the more concise and relevant your comment, the more likely you were to receive a good result.

Example usage and response:

# Important Notes

Google's claim search is not perfect, and relies on claims sources have provided to it, as well as the wording the user provides. The bot will thus not always return the most relevant results, or put them first on the list. <br/><br />I **do not control** the sources that the bot provides, which is why the bot links them. If you doubt a fact check, clink the link and decide for yourself.

# Feedback/Contributing
Feel free to open issues or pull requests under the relevant tabs. I'm hoping this bot will find purpose in the currently complex and volatile journalistic climate.
